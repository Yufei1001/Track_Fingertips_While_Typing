## The effectiveness of cluster tracking algorithm
Regular tracking(right) can't work while the cluster algorithm(left) can achieve stable tracking.

## Applications of the tracking algorithm 
The tracking algorithm can be used as a component to identify keypress event (when the user press a key).
I collected labeled data and did experiments to validate the tracking algorithm as well as the keypress event identification algorithm.
